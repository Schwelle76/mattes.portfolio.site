        <p id = "longDescription">Started as a Hobby Unity Game Programmer 
            during my study of Social Work, programming soon became my Passion. 
            So I went on to Discover the depth of Coding through self-initiated 
            Projects treating topics like Microcontrollers and AI until I decided 
            to start to study the B.Sc. of Code & Context, where I learned about 
            softwaredesign and -architecture, agile team coding, applied Ai, 
            client-server applications, clean code, Internet of thing and more 
            in a more professional manner. The studies were not only about coding 
            but also about ethics, conceptual and visual design as well as fields 
            of business adminisration such as entrepreneurial thinking, market and 
            trend research and business economics.
            Now im striving for new challenges and opportunities to grow.
